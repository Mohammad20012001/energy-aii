# Energy.AI Project

## Overview
The Energy.AI project is a web-based application that provides an AI assistant for users. The assistant can engage in conversations and provide information related to energy solutions. The application features a chat interface where users can interact with the AI.

## Files
- **index.html**: This file contains the main structure of the web page, including the chat interface for the AI assistant. It includes scripts for handling user interactions and sending messages to the AI.
- **styles.css**: This file contains the styles for the web page, defining the layout and appearance of the elements within the HTML file.
- **README.md**: This file provides documentation for the project, explaining its purpose and how to use it.

## Usage
To use the Energy.AI application:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Interact with the AI assistant by typing messages in the chat input box and clicking the send button or pressing Enter.
3. The AI will respond to your messages in the chat interface.

## Voice Functionality
To enhance user experience, the application includes voice functionality that plays the phrase "open energy ai" when the website is opened. This is achieved using the Web Speech API, which allows for speech synthesis in web applications.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional features for the AI assistant to provide more comprehensive responses.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements.
- Optimize the application for mobile devices.
